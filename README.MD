# AKSARA JAWA OBJECT DETECTION USING YOLOv5
This project aims to detect Aksara Jawa characters in an image using YOLOv5. The YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for object detection, and it has shown great performance in detecting various objects.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch 2.0 or higher
- OpenCV 4.5 or higher
- CUDA (optional)
- cuDNN (optional)
